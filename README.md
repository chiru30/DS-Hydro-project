  <h2>Chennai Water Crisis</h2>
  </div>
</div>
Chennai, also known as Madras is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Located on the Coromandel Coast off the Bay of Bengal, it is the biggest cultural, economic and educational centre of south India.
The city is facing an acute water shortage now (June 2019). Chennai is entirely dependent on ground water resources to meet its water needs. There are four reservoirs in the city, namely, Red Hills, Cholavaram, Poondi and Chembarambakkam, with a combined capacity of 11,057 mcft. These are the major sources of fresh water for the city.
Chennai has been facing acute water shortage due to it,s lack of rainfall and mismanagment of water resources.
In this Repo , we will try to find out the reasons and the why such mismanagments happended

## AIM
We have divided this projects into three major parts
  * Insights with Visualizations
  * Creating Forecasting model 
  * Reasons of this water shortage

We want to solve this one by one and by using all the inshights we can get from the above steps create a comprehensive conclusion on ehy chennai faced water shortage


## Language
  The Language used for visualizations and forecasting was Python , and for the the introductory visualizations zoho analytics was used

## Insights
### In this section we will se some example of the Insight module
